Here is an example code that measures water level with an ultrasonic sensor, detects earthquakes with an ADXL335 accelerometer, and sends the data to the Blynk app using an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. This code is written in Arduino IDE.
First, make sure to install the Blynk library and the ADXL335 library before uploading the code to your ESP8266.

In this code, we first define the pins for the ultrasonic sensor and the ADXL335 accelerometer. Then, we set up the Blynk authentication token and Wi-Fi credentials, and create an instance of the ADXL335 class.

In the setup() function, we start the serial communication, initialize the ultrasonic sensor pins, and connect to Wi-Fi and the Blynk server. We also set the accelerometer range to +/- 3g.

In the loop() function, we measure the water level with the ultrasonic sensor and detect earthquakes with the ADXL335 accelerometer. We then send the water level and earthquake data to the Blynk app using the Blynk.virtualWrite() function. Finally, we wait for a few seconds before taking the next measurement.
